# Online Analytical Processing

The databases that a business uses to store all its transactions and records are called [online transaction processing (OLTP)](online-transaction-processing.md) databases. These databases usually have records that are entered one at a time and that contain a wealth of information that can be used by strategists to make informed decisions about their business. The databases that are used to store the data, however, were not designed for analysis. Therefore, retrieving answers from these databases is costly in terms of time and effort. Online analytical processing (OLAP) systems were designed to help extract this business intelligence information from the data in a highly performant way. This is because OLAP databases are optimized for heavy read, low write workloads.

## When to use this solution

Choose OLAP when you need to rapidly execute complex analytical and ad hoc queries without negatively impacting your OLTP systems trying to conduct other transactions. Also consider using this architecture when you want to provide business users with a simple way to generate reports off your data&mdash;without them needing to know how to work with the underlying data relationships or figure out naming conventions&mdash;and when you want to provide a number of aggregations that will allow them to have fast, consistent results. <!--This sentence was a little dense, and I got lost in commas on first read, does this work?-->OLAP really shines when you want to apply aggregate calculations over large amounts of data.

## Benefits

OLAP systems are optimized for read heavy scenarios, such as analytics and business intelligence.

OLAP allows business users to slice and dice <!--I've flagged this elsewhere as slang. It should be replaced with something that will work for ESL readers. Note it is not commonly used on MSDN.--> data as needed, regardless of whether the source data is partitioned across several data sources. This helps users to find trends, spot patterns, drill down, and "wander" <!--This also feels like slang, or at least may not be as clear to an ESL reader.--> around the data without having to know the detailed ins and outs of traditional data analysis.

[Semantic models](../common-architectures/relational-data.md#semantic-modeling) can help business users abstract relationship complexities and make it easier to analyze the data much faster than they'd be able to otherwise, if at all.

## Challenges

For all the benefits OLAP systems provide, they do produce a few challenges:

- Whereas data in OLTP systems is constantly updated through transactions flowing in from various sources, OLAP data stores are typically refreshed at a much slower cadence, depending on business needs. This means OLAP systems are better suited for strategic business decisions, rather than immediate responses to changes. Additionally, some level of data cleansing and orchestration needs to be planned to keep the OLAP data stores up-to-date.
- Unlike traditional, normalized, relational tables found in OLTP systems, OLAP data models tend to be multidimensional. This makes it difficult or impossible to directly map to entity-relationship or object-oriented models, where each attribute is mapped to one column. Instead, OLAP systems typically use a star or snowflake schema in place of traditional normalization.

## OLAP in Azure

In Azure, data held in OLTP systems such as Azure SQL Database is copied into the OLAP system, such as [Azure Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-overview). Data exploration and visualization tools like [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com), Excel, and third-party options connect to Analysis Services servers and provide users with highly interactive and visually rich insights into the modeled data. The flow of data from OLTP data to OLAP is typically orchestrated using SQL Server Integration Services, such as can be executed using [Azure Data Factory](/azure/data-factory/concepts-integration-runtime).
